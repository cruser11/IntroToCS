# Strings and Files

## Ends Sunday, April 5

## Description and Goals

This is our first post-break unit, one of the three we're going to complete before the end of the semester. We have the following goals:

1. **Survive the transition to the new class format**.

2. Learn more about working with strings in Python, including how to index individual characters in a string. These techniques will show up again in the next unit when we look at lists and dictionaries.

3. Learn how to work with text files. We'll focus on opening and reading through files, then using string processing to pick out data values of interest.

4. Keep making progress on the online autograded problem sets.

## Assignments

I've decided **not** to assign any additional project for this unit. We have enough to manage with the transition to the new format,
and you're going to be working through a lot of issues with your other classes.

Instead, your only work requirement is to keep blasting away at the autograded problem sets that are already on Mimir.

Most of you have finished up through Assignment 4 and some of Assignment 5 by this point. You should focus on moving forward with
Assignments 5 and 6 and using the new material in this unit to complete Assignment 7, which is all about string processing and
working with files.

Remember that I'm now encouraging you to work with your teammates to make progress on the assignments so you don't become isolated
and turtle up.

If you're significantly behind on the problem sets, you should prioritize getting caught up. Don't wait until the last minute!

*P.S. Assignment 7 is my favorite*.


## To-Do List

- Connect with your team members on Slack. I recommend establishing a goal of checking in each day so you stay engaged with each other.

- Use the instructions below to download the data files from Canvas and upload them to your Mimir workspace so you can follow along
with the examples in the videos. Note that you don't need to upload or download any special files to do Assignment 7: the file for that project is automatically loaded with all of the tests.

- Watch the videos posted to Canvas. I recommend watching the videos one-at-a-time: don't binge watch them. Remember that you can pause, rewind, or rewatch the videos as needed.

- Read [Chapter 8 of *Think Python*](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2009.html) on strings, indexing, and looping.

- Continue working on the autograded Mimir assignments with your teammates. This unit will give you the tools you need to complete up through Assignment 7.
