# Course Updates

## Contents

This document describes the changes we'll be making to the class in response to our shift to virtual instruction for the second half of
Spring 2020.

Please read this carefully and let me know if you have questions. It covers

- Tools we're going to use.

- Updates to our schedule and assignments.

- My plans for delivering content to you.

- How office hours will work.

Some things, like the status of the final exam, are still uncertain. I'll make decisions on those once we've had a few weeks to adjust to
the new course format.

## Collaboration

Previously, I'd encouraged you to talk with your classmates about the course work, but to develop all of your submissions indpendently.
Under our new situation, **I don't want you to feel isolated**, so I'm now **encouraging you to collaborate freely** to complete the
course work.

Collaboration is an **option**, not a requirement, and I won't be creating teams or assigning group projects. If you do choose to
work with others, I just ask that you still submit your work individually (so I have a record of everything that was turned in)
and note in your submission who you worked with.

You can, if you like, think of this as an environment where we're still completing indvidual assignments, but you're allowed to
freely discuss and check your work with your fellow students.
