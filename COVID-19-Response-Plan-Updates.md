## Contents

This document describes the changes we'll be making to the class in response to our shift to virtual instruction for the second half of
Spring 2020.

Please read this carefully and let me know if you have questions. It covers:

- Tools we're going to use.
- Updates to our schedule and assignments.
- My plans for delivering content to you.
- How office hours will work.

Some things, like the status of the final exam, are still uncertain. I'll make decisions on those once we've had a few weeks to adjust to
the new course format.

**Please remember that I'm always available to help you and answer your questions**. The format of our course has changed, but I'm 
still your professor and I'm still committed to helping each of you succeed.

You should always feel free to get in touch with me by e-mail, by Slack (discussed below), or in WebEx. If you need to set up a time
to meet live via WebEx, I'm happy to accomodate that.

## Collaboration

Previously, I'd encouraged you to talk with your classmates about the course work, but to develop all of your submissions indpendently.
Under our new situation, **I don't want you to feel isolated**, so I'm now **encouraging you to collaborate freely** to complete the
course work. To start, I'll group you into teams roughly based on the people that you've been working with in class so far. Think of your team as your remote study group. 

Note that we're not doing "group projects": **please continue to submit your work individually** so I have a record of everything that's 
turned in. You can, if you like, think of this as an environment where we're still completing indvidual assignments, but you're allowed 
to freely discuss and check your work with your fellow students.

We'll stay with the initial teams for a couple of weeks: if you want rearrange to work with other people or if you'd prefer to work independently after that point then you can feel free to make changes.

## Tools

### Slack

Slack is an instant messaging app that's now widely used as a replacement for e-mail in many companies. I've created a Slack
channel for our class, `#cms-195-spring-2020`.

Use the invite link posted to Canvas to join the channel. Once you've joined, post a quick intro message and a meme to let me know you've made it.

Slack will be for general questions, daily check-ins, posting memes and links, etc. It's intended to be a way for us to stay engaged
with each other and to provide opportunities for casual question and answer sessions and collaboration. I won't be using Slack to 
distribute course content.

### GitHub

We'll continue to use this GitHub site, `dansmyers/IntroToCS`, to keep distributing class content, handouts, and examples.

### Canvas

We'll keep using Canvas for grades, official course e-mails, and posting course-specific links that I don't want to put on GitHub.

### WebEx

I'll use WebEx for online office hours, discussed in more detail below.

**I do not plan to lecture synchronously over WebEx**. I know that our initial guidance from the Provost emphasized delivering classes synchronously, but I don't think that format is well-suited for our course. Instead, we will deliver most of the basic course content
asynchronously, using videos and readings, and use video conferencing for check-ins and office hours.
