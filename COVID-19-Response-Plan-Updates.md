# Course Updates

## Contents

This document describes the changes we'll be making to the class in response to our shift to virtual instruction for the second half of
Spring 2020.

Please read this carefully and let me know if you have questions. It covers

- Tools we're going to use.

- Updates to our schedule and assignments.

- My plans for delivering content to you.

- How office hours will work.

Some things, like the status of the final exam, are still uncertain. I'll make decisions on those once we've had a few weeks to adjust to
the new course format.

## Collaboration

Previously, I'd encouraged you to talk with your classmates about the course work, but to develop all of your submissions indpendently.
Under our new situation, **I don't want you to feel isolated**, so I'm now **encouraging you to collaborate freely** to complete the
course work.

**Collaboration is an option**, not a requirement, and I won't be creating teams or assigning group projects. If you do choose to
work with others, I just ask that you still submit your work individually (so I have a record of everything that was turned in)
and note in your submission who you worked with.

You can, if you like, think of this as an environment where we're still completing indvidual assignments, but you're allowed to
freely discuss and check your work with your fellow students.

## Tools

### Slack

Slack is an instant messaging app that's now being widely used as a replacement for e-mail in many companies. I've created a Slack
channel for our class, `#cms-195-spring-2020`.

Use the invite link posted to Canvas to join the channel. Once you've joined, post a quick intro message to let me know you've made it.

Slack will be for general questions, daily check-ins, posting memes and links, etc. It's intended to be a way for us to stay engaged
with each other and to provide opportunities for casual question and answer sessions and collaboration. I won't be using Slack to 
distribute course content.

### GitHub

We'll continue to use this GitHub site, `dansmyers/IntroToCS`, to keep distributing class content, handouts, and examples.

### Canvas

We'll keep using Canvas for grades, official course e-mails, and posting course-specific links that I don't want to put on GitHub.

### WebEx

I'll use WebEx for online office hours, discussed in more detail below.

**I do not plan to lecture synchronously over WebEx**. I know that the initial guidance from the Provost emphasized delivering classes synchronously, but I don't think that format is well-suited for our course. Instead, we will deliver most of the basic course content
asynchronously and use video conferencing for check-ins and office hours.
