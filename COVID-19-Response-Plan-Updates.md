# CMS 195 Spring 2020: COVID-19 Response Plan

## This page is still under construction. I'll send an e-mail to the class when the final version is ready.

## Contents

This document describes the changes we'll be making to the class in response to our shift to virtual instruction for the second half of
Spring 2020.

Please read this carefully and let me know if you have questions. It covers:

- Tools we're going to use.
- Updates to our schedule and assignments.
- My plans for delivering content to you.
- How office hours will work.

**Please remember that I'm always available to help you and answer your questions**. The format of our course has changed, but I'm 
still your professor and I'm still committed to helping each of you succeed.

You should always feel free to get in touch with me by e-mail, by Slack (discussed below), or in WebEx. If you need to set up a time
to meet live via WebEx, I'm happy to accomodate that.

## Collaboration

Previously, I'd encouraged you to talk with your classmates about the course work, but to develop all of your submissions indpendently.
Under our new situation, **I don't want you to feel isolated**, so I'm now **encouraging you to collaborate freely** to complete the
course work. To start, I'll group you into teams roughly based on the people that you've been working with in class so far. Think of your team as your remote study group. 

Note that we're not doing "group projects": **please continue to submit your work individually** so I have a record of everything that's 
turned in. You can, if you like, think of this as an environment where we're still completing indvidual assignments, but you're allowed 
to freely discuss and check your work with your fellow students.

I'll start by sending each team an invite to a dedicated Slack group. We'll stay with the initial teams for a couple of weeks: if you 
want rearrange to work with other people or if you'd prefer to work independently after that point then you can feel free to make 
changes.

## Tools

### Slack

Slack is an instant messaging app that's now widely used as a replacement for e-mail in many companies. I've created a Slack
channel for our class, `#cms-195-spring-2020`.

Use the invite link posted to Canvas to join the channel. Once you've joined, post a quick intro message and a meme to let me know you've made it.

Slack will be for general discussions, questions about course logistics, check-ins, posting memes and links, etc. It's intended to be a 
way for us to stay engaged with each other and to provide opportunities for casual question and answer sessions and collaboration.

**I won't distribute course content through Slack**.

### GitHub

We'll continue to use this GitHub site, `dansmyers/IntroToCS`, to keep distributing class content, handouts, and examples.

### Canvas

We'll keep using Canvas for grades, official course e-mails, and posting course-specific links that I don't want to put on the public 
GitHub.

### WebEx

I'll use WebEx for online office hours, discussed in more detail below.

**I do not plan to lecture synchronously over WebEx**. I know that our initial guidance from the Provost emphasized delivering classes synchronously, but I don't think that format is well-suited for our course. Instead, we will deliver most of the basic course content
asynchronously, using videos and readings, and use video conferencing for check-ins and office hours.

## Updated Course Schedule

### Remaining Topics

We have three major topics to get through for the rest of the semester:

- Strings and working with files
- Using Python's built-in lists and dictionaries
- An intro to object-oriented programming and classes

If we were in-person, we'd be able to add a unit on graphics programming, but it won't be feasible to do that in the new format (it
requires installing more software and some hands-on configuration). Those of you planning to continue with CMS 121 as your next computer 
science class will be perfectly well-prepared if we get through these last three units by the end of the semester.

My plan is to dedicate about two weeks to each unit. Each of the remaining units will have a deliverable project.


| Unit         | Topic                         | Start  |   End  | Deliverable     |
| -------------|-----------------------------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 1            | Files and Strings           |   3/25 |  4/5  | Number One Jams (Billboard Chart Data Analysis)  |
| 2            | Lists and Dictionaries      |   4/6 |  4/19  | It's a Secret to Everybody (Cryptography)    |
| 3            | Classes and Objects         |  4/20  |  End of the Semester  | Build Something Awesome |

### Autograded Problem Sets

Continue to work on the autograded problem sets. You are still responsible for finishing at least 90% of the autograded problems
by the end of the semester to get full credit.

Unit 1 (files and strings) will cover all of the material you need for Problem Set 7. Unit 2 (lists) will cover the material for 
Problem Set 8.

### Final Exam

**The last project will substitute for the final exam**.  We will not have a written final. Giving a written exam remotely
is tough, and at this point I want to prioritize writing as much code as possible.

### Labs

The entire Science Division is dealing with the challenge of translating lab experiences to the remote format. Although this class's 
labs are theoretically easier to move online, the reality is that they still require a lot of in-person discussion and explanation in 
order to be effective.

Our remaining labs would have been based around using some interesting built-in libraries of Python to do things like plotting,
text analysis, and predictive modeling. If we were in-person, I'd be able to quickly debug any issues that came up with the new
features and answer your questions, but I don't feel comfortable expecting you to work with unfamiliar software in the remote
format.

Here's my plan: the first project will require you do a little bit of data analysis to answer some questions about the history of
the Billboard record charts. After that point, we'll have completed about four labs, in addition to the other simulation-related
projects that are in Problem Set 6. I feel comfortable leaving that as a sufficient amount of lab work for this semester.

### Challenge Projects

Two challenge projects have been posted:

- Writing a tutorial blog post about a feature of Python or example problem. To simplify this project: **you don't need to publish your post on the web**. You can complete the post in a regular text editor and then upload it to an assignment on Canvas that I'll create.

- Solving some problems from Project Euler.

There will be a reflective writing challenge project posted toward the end of the semester and one more programming-related project.
